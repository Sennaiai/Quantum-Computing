## Qaunatum Computing Essentials

# 1. Linear lagebra 
          # a. operations - 
                    - inner product - multiplication of 2 vectors reulting in a scalar. Measures the overlap between the vectors.
                    - outer product - combines two vectors forming a matrix. 
                    - Vector space - a set of vectors.
                    - Tenrsor product - a process of jining vecotr spaces into a larger joint space.
                                      - represent composite quantum states, xpanding the hilbert space. 
          
 
# 2. Quantum mechanics
          a. Wave function interpretation - a mathematical decription of the quantum state of a particle, describing the                                             probability ampltudes of all possible states.
          b. Qauntum state - the complete description of a sysytem's physical (observableor measureable) conditions.
          c. Dirac notation - mathematical notation of a quantum state. 
          d. Probablity amplitudes - a complex number whose magnitude squared gives the probability of a specific                                            quantum outcome. 
          e. Hilbert space - a complete vector space used to describe all possible quantum states.
          f. Bloch sphere - geometric represenation of a quanutm state
          g. Basis States - a set of fundamental qauntum states spanning a Hilbert space.
                          - Any stae can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis states.
          h. Measurement - an interactive process with a quantum state to observe its behaviour and causing it to                                   colapse into one definite outcome of all possible quantum states reprsented by its wave                                  function.
          i. Expectation value - the avergae utcome of measuring an observable quantum state
          j. Operators - matehamtical objects that act on qauntum states producing new measurable quantum states.
                       - represent observable quantum states, evolutions f qauntum states and transformations of quantum                          states.
          k. Hermitian operators - represent observable quantum states
          l. Unitary operators - represent reversible quanutm evolution of a given quantum state
          m. Uncertainity principle - a principle defining the limitation on certain observables that cannot be                                                precisely determined simultaneously. 
          n. Commutators - mathematical operation measuring how two operators fail to be measured simultaneously.
