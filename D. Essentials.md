## Quantum Computing Essentials

### 1. Linear Algebra  
- **Inner product** – multiplication of two vectors resulting in a scalar; measures the overlap between the vectors.
  
- **Outer product** – combines two vectors to form a matrix.
  
- **Vector space** – a set of vectors.
  
- **Tensor product** – a process of joining vector spaces into a larger joint space; represents composite quantum states, expanding the Hilbert space.
  
- **Eigen vector** - non-zero vector, whose diection remains unchanged under a given linear tasnformation
  
- **Eigen value** - a scalar factor that represents a linear transformation of an eigen-vector.

### 2. Quantum Mechanics  
**Wave function interpretation** – a mathematical description of the quantum state of a particle, expressing the probability amplitudes of all possible states.  

**Quantum state** – the complete description of a system’s physical (observable or measurable) conditions.  

**Dirac notation** – mathematical notation representing a quantum state.  

**Probability amplitude** – a complex number whose magnitude squared gives the probability of a specific quantum outcome.  

**Hilbert space** – a complete vector space used to describe all possible quantum states.  

**Bloch sphere** – geometric representation of a quantum state.  

**Basis states** – a set of fundamental quantum states spanning a Hilbert space; any state can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis states.  

**Measurement** – an interactive process with a quantum system that causes it to collapse into one definite outcome among all possible states represented by its wave function. 

**Expectation value** – the average outcome of measuring an observable on a quantum state.  

**Operators** – mathematical objects that act on quantum states to produce new measurable states; represent observables, evolutions, or transformations of quantum states.  

**Hermitian operators** – represent observable quantum states.  

**Unitary operators** – represent reversible quantum evolutions of a given quantum state.  

**Uncertainty principle** – a principle defining the limitation on certain observables that cannot be precisely determined simultaneously.  

**Commutators** – mathematical operation measuring how two operators fail to be measured simultaneously.

**Superpositions** - a linear composition of linear basis states representing a system existing in multiple possible states simultaneously until measuremnt collapses it into one definite state.

**Enatngleemtn** - a unique quantum state shared between two or more states that exist in sync with one another regardless of distancea. 

**Bell-state** - a maximally entangled quantum state of two qubits, where the systems remain perfectly correlated.

**Qubit** - a basic unit of single qauntum infomration.

**Initialization** - process of preparing a qubit in a known starting state.

**Eigen state** - qauntum state with a definite value for a given observable.
                - definite value is the eigen value and the obsrvable is the operator.
                
**Observable** - a measurable physical quantity like energy, momentum, position ...etc

### 3. Density Matrix

**Matrix represenation** - a way of mathematical expression of quantum states and operators as matrices and vectors

**Density matrix** - mathematical representation of a quantum system's state. Useful for describing mixed states.

**Pure state** - completley known qauntum state that can be represented by a single state vector in Hilbert space

**Mixed state** - a statistical representation of a mixture of multiple pure states, describing a system that is not in one definite state but exists in a probability distribution over several possible states.

**Ensemble** - the physical or conceptual collection of quantum states, statisticaly represented by mixed state.


**Outer product (description)**

### 4. Gates

 **Gate** - basic operation in quantum computing that chnages the stae of a single or multiple qubits.

 **Phase** - change of amplitude or orientation of the quantum state.
         
         **Changes the way qubits interact or interefere with one another**

 **Rotation** - change of the actual position of quanutm state of a qubit
         **Changes the weight or probability of a given state**
 
**Single gate** - acts on single qubit at a time 

    **Pauli X** - Bit flip (like NOT gate)
    **Pauli Z** - Phase flip 
    **Pauli Y** - Bit and Phase flip 
    **R(x/y/z)** - Rotation around x/y/z
    **Hadamard** - Creates superposition 

**Multi-qubit gates** act on multiple qubits at a time 
   
    **CX** - Controlled X (Conditional NOT)
    **CZ** - Conditional Z (phase flip)
    **CCX (Toffolli)** - 2x Conditional NOT (Similar to CCNOT in classical) 
    **SWAP** - exchanges the qubit states of 2 qubits at a time

**Combination** - more gates can be created by combining the above single and/or multi qubit gates.

### 5. Circuits

**No-Cloning thereom** - A qauntum state can not be completle copied or cloned, due to the linearity of the state.
        - cloning is non-lnear whereas Quanutm is linear.

**Teleportation** - the trasnfer of qauntum state from one entanged pair to its other entangled pair instantaneously regardelss to distance. But requires exchage of classical infomration, thus no information echange faster then the speed of light keeping Einstein happy! 

**Deustch** - a quantum algorithm that demonstrates quantum parallelism, capable of determining whether a given function is constant or balanced in a single evaluation.

**Deustch-Josza** - 

**QFT** -

**Phase Estimation** -

**Parallelism** -
