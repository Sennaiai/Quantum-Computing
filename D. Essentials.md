## Quantum Computing Essentials

### 1. Linear Algebra  
- **Inner product** – multiplication of two vectors resulting in a scalar; measures the overlap between the vectors.  
- **Outer product** – combines two vectors to form a matrix.  
- **Vector space** – a set of vectors.  
- **Tensor product** – a process of joining vector spaces into a larger joint space; represents composite quantum states, expanding the Hilbert space.  
- **Eigen vector** - non-zero vector, whose diection remains unchanged under a given linear tasnformation
- **Eigen value** - a scalar factor that represents a linear transformation of an eigen-vector.

### 2. Quantum Mechanics  
**Wave function interpretation** – a mathematical description of the quantum state of a particle, expressing the probability amplitudes of all possible states.  
**Quantum state** – the complete description of a system’s physical (observable or measurable) conditions.  
**Dirac notation** – mathematical notation representing a quantum state.  
**Probability amplitude** – a complex number whose magnitude squared gives the probability of a specific quantum outcome.  
**Hilbert space** – a complete vector space used to describe all possible quantum states.  
**Bloch sphere** – geometric representation of a quantum state.  
**Basis states** – a set of fundamental quantum states spanning a Hilbert space; any state can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis states.  
**Measurement** – an interactive process with a quantum system that causes it to collapse into one definite outcome among all possible states represented by its wave function.  
**Expectation value** – the average outcome of measuring an observable on a quantum state.  
**Operators** – mathematical objects that act on quantum states to produce new measurable states; represent observables, evolutions, or transformations of quantum states.  
**Hermitian operators** – represent observable quantum states.  
**Unitary operators** – represent reversible quantum evolutions of a given quantum state.  
**Uncertainty principle** – a principle defining the limitation on certain observables that cannot be precisely determined simultaneously.  
**Commutators** – mathematical operation measuring how two operators fail to be measured simultaneously.
**Superpositions** - a linear composition of linear basis states representing a system existing in multiple possible states simultaneously until measuremnt collapses it into one definite state.
**Enatngleemtn** - a unique quantum state shared between two or more states that exist in sync with one another regardless of distancea. 
**Bell-state** - a maximally entangled quantum state of two qubits, where the systems remain perfectly correlated.
**Qubit** - a basic unit of single qauntum infomration.
**Initialization** - process of preparing a qubit in a known starting state.
**Eigen state** - qauntum state with a definite value for a given observable.
                - definite value is the eigen value and the obsrvable is the operator.
**Observable** - a measurable physical quantity like energy, momentum, position ...et.
