## Quantum Computing Essentials

### 1. Linear Algebra  
**a. Operations**  
- **Inner product** – multiplication of two vectors resulting in a scalar; measures the overlap between the vectors.  
- **Outer product** – combines two vectors to form a matrix.  
- **Vector space** – a set of vectors.  
- **Tensor product** – a process of joining vector spaces into a larger joint space; represents composite quantum states, expanding the Hilbert space.

### 2. Quantum Mechanics  
**a. Wave function interpretation** – a mathematical description of the quantum state of a particle, expressing the probability amplitudes of all possible states.  
**b. Quantum state** – the complete description of a system’s physical (observable or measurable) conditions.  
**c. Dirac notation** – mathematical notation representing a quantum state.  
**d. Probability amplitude** – a complex number whose magnitude squared gives the probability of a specific quantum outcome.  
**e. Hilbert space** – a complete vector space used to describe all possible quantum states.  
**f. Bloch sphere** – geometric representation of a quantum state.  
**g. Basis states** – a set of fundamental quantum states spanning a Hilbert space; any state can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis states.  
**h. Measurement** – an interactive process with a quantum system that causes it to collapse into one definite outcome among all possible states represented by its wave function.  
**i. Expectation value** – the average outcome of measuring an observable on a quantum state.  
**j. Operators** – mathematical objects that act on quantum states to produce new measurable states; represent observables, evolutions, or transformations of quantum states.  
**k. Hermitian operators** – represent observable quantum states.  
**l. Unitary operators** – represent reversible quantum evolutions of a given quantum state.  
**m. Uncertainty principle** – a principle defining the limitation on certain observables that cannot be precisely determined simultaneously.  
**n. Commutators** – mathematical operation measuring how two operators fail to be measured simultaneously.
