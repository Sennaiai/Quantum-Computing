# Quantum Computing  
by **Sennai Kahssai**

Welcome! 

This repository chronicles my journey into **Quantum Computing**, where I explore its intersections with **Machine Learning/AI**, **Cellular & Molecular Biology**, and **Philosophy**.
## About Me
I'm currently pursuing a **Master’s in Quantum Computing** at the **University of Calgary**, with an academic background in **Molecular & Cellular Biology** and **Philosophy**. My focus is on applying quantum technologies to real-world challenges in **molecular biology**, **systems biology**, and **medicine**, guided by philosophical insight.

This repository serves as both a **learning journal** and a **project hub**, where I share tutorials, medium-scale projects, and interdisciplinary reflections as I build a career at the crossroads of **science**, **systems**, and **emerging technologies**.
