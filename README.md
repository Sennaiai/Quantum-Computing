## Overview

This repository contains my technical portfolio in **quantum computing for the life sciences**, focused on **computational drug discovery and molecular-scale modeling**.

Quantum technology is a broad field. My work is centered on three pillars that are directly relevant to biological and chemical systems:

- **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)**
- **Quantum Optimization**
- **Quantum Molecular Simulation**

Together, these form a unified framework for learning, simulating, and optimizing molecular systems — from binding energies to reaction pathways and biological function.

## Background and Focus

My training spans **Molecular & Cellular Biology, Physics, Chemistry, and Computation**.

I bring wet-lab experience in molecular biology, enzymology, genetics, and biochemistry together with classical and quantum computing, numerical modeling, and machine learning. I am currently completing a **Master’s degree in Quantum Computing**, alongside advanced training in **ML/AI**, with the objective of applying quantum-enabled methods to biological and chemical problems.

The guiding aim of this work is simple:

> **Use quantum and hybrid quantum–classical algorithms to model, simulate, and optimize molecular systems relevant to drug discovery and biological function.**

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized the way a computational molecular lab works.

### `notebooks/`
Executable Jupyter notebooks implementing:
- Quantum machine-learning models  
- Quantum optimization pipelines  
- Molecular Hamiltonians and variational solvers  
- Hybrid quantum–classical workflows  

Each notebook is self-documented via Markdown cells at the top of the file.

### `theory/`
Mathematical and physical foundations:
- **`basics.md`** — qubits, states, operators, measurement  
- **`algorithms.md`** — VQE, QAOA, QRC, and related methods  
- **`models.md`** — Hamiltonians, encodings, ansätze, cost functions  

---

### `resources/`
Curated references for working in quantum life-science modeling:
- **`conferences.md`** — major research and industry venues  
- **`reading.md`** — key books, journals, and papers  
- **`tools.md`** — quantum and molecular modeling frameworks

## Scientific Orientation

The work here sits at the intersection of:

- Quantum computation  
- Molecular physics and chemistry  
- Machine learning  
- Biological systems  

The three pillars — **QML, Optimization, and Molecular Simulation** — are treated as components of a single computational stack for understanding and designing molecular systems in biology and medicine.
