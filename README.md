# Quantum Computing  
by **Sennai Kahssai**

Welcome! 

This repository chronicles my journey into **Quantum Computing**, where I explore its intersections with **Machine Learning/AI**, **Cellular & Molecular Biology**, and **Philosophy**.
## About Me
I'm currently pursuing a **Master’s in Quantum Computing** at the **University of Calgary**, with an academic background in **Molecular & Cellular Biology** and **Philosophy**. My focus is on applying quantum technologies to real-world challenges in **molecular biology**, **systems biology**, and **medicine**, guided by philosophical insight.

This repository serves as both a **learning journal** and a **project hub**, where I share tutorials, medium-scale projects, and interdisciplinary reflections as I build a career at the crossroads of **science**, **systems**, and **emerging technologies**.
## Repository Structure
### Notebooks  
Organized by theme and topic, each notebook represents a step in my learning journey:
- `notebooks/quantum_computing/` – Hardware, gates, Qiskit, and quantum algorithms  
- `notebooks/machine_learning_ai/` – ML models, scikit-learn, and AI theory  
- `notebooks/project_management/` – Certification notes and productivity tools  
### Projects  
Medium-scale, applied projects categorized by area of integration:
- `projects/classical_ml_ai/` – Core machine learning projects using traditional tools (e.g., scikit-learn, XGBoost)  
- `projects/hybrid_qml_model/` – Quantum ML classifiers and hybrid pipelines  
- `projects/quantum_computing_project/` – Hands-on project applying basic quantum concepts  
- `projects/quantum_biology_project/` – Modeling molecular systems using quantum-inspired frameworks  
### Learning Journey  
Weekly updates and reflections from the MQuaC program and ML/AI studies:
- `learning_journey/` – Logs, insights, breakthroughs, and personal notes  
### Resources  
Curated materials for continued learning:
- `resources/references.md` – Research papers, toolkits, and reading lists  
## Current Focus Areas
- Mastering quantum computing — hardware, algorithms, and platforms like **Qiskit** and **PennyLane**  
- Integrating machine learning frameworks with quantum backends  
- Exploring the philosophical implications of quantum information in relation to **biological systems**, **consciousness**, and **real-world applications**  
- Earning a **project management certification**  
- Sharing progress through **GitHub**, **LinkedIn**, and **personal blog platforms**
