## Interest
My interest in quantum biology began with my studies in molecular biology and readings such as *What Is Life?* by Schrödinger, *Life on the Edge*, *Physics in Mind*, and *Quantum Supremacy*. These works, together with my background in physics, biology, and philosophy, shaped my curiosity about the quantum nature of living systems. Guided by mentors and philosophical reflection, this curiosity evolved into a focused pursuit of quantum computing.

## Life Sciences & Quantum Computing
Quantum computing is not a departure from biology but a way to expand it — a bridge linking molecular science, computation, and technology. I see it as a natural continuation of my interest in understanding life through the principles of information and coherence. This journey now continues as I work to integrate quantum computation with biology to explore the fundamental nature of living systems.

## Training
I began formal training in quantum computing as a Masters student in Quantum Computing at the **University of Calgary**. My work spans quantum software, hardware, and applications, with projects focusing on applying quantum technologies to industry problems. In parallel, I am completing an **IBM certification in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**, aiming to merge ML/AI with quantum computing for biological and industry modeling and discovery.
