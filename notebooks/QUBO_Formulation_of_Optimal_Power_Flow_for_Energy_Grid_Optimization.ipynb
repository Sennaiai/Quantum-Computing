        "Modern electrical grids are becoming increasingly complex due to renewable integration, distributed generation, and real-time operational constraints. Classical OPF solvers must repeatedly solve large nonconvex optimization problems under tight time requirements, often relying on approximations that trade optimality for speed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Quantum optimization methods offer a fundamentally different approach by exploiting quantum parallelism to explore complex solution landscapes. Reformulating OPF as a QUBO problem allows it to be mapped directly to quantum annealers and hybrid quantum–classical optimizers, providing a potential pathway toward faster or more scalable grid optimization in future quantum-enabled control systems.\n"

        "\n",
        "To enable quantum optimization, the constrained OPF formulation is transformed into an unconstrained quadratic objective using penalty methods. Continuous variables are discretized into binary encodings, and all constraints are absorbed into the objective function. The resulting Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) form is compatible with quantum annealing and variational quantum algorithms.\n",

        "In this notebook, feasibility is enforced primarily through the binary-to-real decoding map, which restricts decoded generation and voltage values to physically valid operating ranges. As a result, explicit penalty terms for box constraints are unnecessary in this formulation. This implementation therefore represents a proof-of-principle QUBO-style discretization and optimization workflow for an OPF-inspired objective. Extension to full OPF formulations with network and power-balance constraints is a natural next step and is outlined in the Future Directions section.\n"

        "This study demonstrates the feasibility of encoding a simplified Optimal Power Flow problem into QUBO form, enabling its solution using quantum optimization paradigms. While classical solvers remain highly efficient for many OPF instances, their performance can degrade as system size and constraint complexity increase.\n",

        "The QUBO formulation provides a direct interface between power system optimization and quantum hardware, offering a foundation for future hybrid quantum–classical grid control systems. Importantly, this work focuses on structural feasibility rather than near-term performance superiority, emphasizing methodological integration rather than immediate quantum advantage.\n"

        "\n",
        "A defining distinction between classical and quantum optimization lies in the structure of the underlying state space. Classical algorithms explore configurations sequentially within a discrete or continuous parameter space. Quantum systems, by contrast, evolve within exponentially large Hilbert spaces, where superposition and entanglement allow simultaneous representation of vast numbers of candidate solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a quantum system of (n) qubits, the computational state resides in a (2^n)-dimensional Hilbert space, enabling quantum algorithms to process global features of the optimization landscape that are inaccessible to purely classical methods. Superposition permits parallel exploration of many configurations, while entanglement encodes high-order correlations between variables, reshaping the effective geometry of the search space.\n",
        "\n",
        "This capability is particularly relevant for complex engineering systems such as power grids, where objective landscapes are highly nonlinear and strongly coupled. Quantum evolution naturally operates through continuous transformations of quantum states, offering a fundamentally different mode of computation compared to discrete classical search trajectories.\n",
        "\n",
        "From this perspective, discretized QUBO mappings represent a near-term compromise rather than the ultimate form of quantum optimization. As quantum hardware matures, algorithms that exploit continuous quantum dynamics and high-dimensional entangled state spaces may enable more direct and efficient exploration of complex optimization landscapes, providing a deeper pathway toward quantum advantage in large-scale infrastructure systems.\n"

Integration with hybrid solvers combining classical preprocessing and quantum subproblem optimization represents a promising near-term pathway.\n",
