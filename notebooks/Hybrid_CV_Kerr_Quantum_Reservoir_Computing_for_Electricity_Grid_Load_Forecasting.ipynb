        "Standard (linear or weakly nonlinear) reservoirs can be limited in their ability to generate sufficiently expressive nonlinear temporal embeddings from multivariate inputs. A Kerr element introduces a controllable nonlinearity into the continuous-variable dynamics, potentially improving reservoir richness and memory properties while keeping the training procedure lightweight (training only the classical readout).\n",

        "\n",
        "This study evaluates CV-Kerr QRC primarily in simulation, which may not capture hardware effects such as noise, loss, and finite squeezing in real photonic systems. In addition, simulation cost can grow rapidly with reservoir size and time horizon, limiting scaling experiments in a notebook setting.\n",

        "### Computational Constraints and Hilbert Space Scaling\n",
        "\n",
        "An important practical limitation of the present study arises from the rapid growth of the continuous-variable Hilbert space. CV quantum systems scale exponentially with the number of modes and photon-number cutoff, leading to a steep increase in simulation cost as reservoir size and nonlinearity are increased. As a result, the reservoir dimensionality and Kerr strength explored here were necessarily constrained by available computational resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "This limitation implies that the full dynamical richness of CV-Kerr reservoirs could not be exhaustively explored. Larger reservoirs and higher cutoffs may enable more expressive temporal embeddings and improved memory capacity, but were infeasible within a notebook-scale simulation environment. Consequently, the reported performance should be interpreted as a **lower bound** on the potential of CV-Kerr QRC rather than a definitive performance ceiling.\n",
        "\n",
        "This computational bottleneck highlights a key motivation for hardware-based continuous-variable quantum computing: physical photonic systems naturally evolve in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces without incurring the exponential simulation cost faced on classical hardware. As such, experimental CV quantum reservoirs may access dynamical regimes that are currently inaccessible to classical simulation.\n"

        "\n",
        "The CV-Kerr Quantum Reservoir Computing (CV-Kerr QRC) results should be interpreted in the context of strong classical and quantum baselines. Classical Random Forest models remain highly competitive for electricity load forecasting due to their ability to capture nonlinear weather–time interactions and complex demand dynamics. In our classical benchmark, Random Forest achieved the lowest test error among classical models, establishing a stringent reference point for any quantum approach. \n",
        "\n",
        "The motivation for introducing quantum reservoirs is not to replace classical models immediately, but to explore alternative learning paradigms that may scale more favorably as model complexity increases. Classical deep models often require large numbers of trainable parameters and repeated optimization across many layers to capture nonlinear temporal structure. By contrast, reservoir computing fixes the internal dynamics and trains only a lightweight readout layer. In the quantum setting, the reservoir’s natural unitary evolution can generate a rich nonlinear feature map without deep parameter optimization. \n",
        "\n",
        "The CV-Kerr architecture is particularly attractive because the Kerr nonlinearity enriches reservoir dynamics beyond linear or weakly nonlinear regimes. This enables more expressive temporal embeddings using a small number of quantum modes, which is critical under near-term hardware constraints. Continuous-variable systems naturally operate on amplitudes and phases, matching the structure of electricity demand signals and avoiding heavy discretization or large qubit registers. \n",
        "\n",
        "While near-term quantum reservoirs may not yet outperform optimized classical ensembles, they demonstrate a fundamentally different path to nonlinear representation learning. As hardware improves, quantum reservoirs may offer competitive expressivity with reduced training overhead, particularly in large-scale temporal modeling tasks.\n"

        "**Transition to photonic hardware.**\n",
        "Current experiments rely on simulation, which does not fully capture noise, loss, and finite squeezing present in real continuous-variable systems. Implementing CV-Kerr QRC on photonic platforms would allow evaluation under realistic operating conditions and provide a clearer assessment of near-term feasibility. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Hybrid quantum–attention architectures.**\n",
        "Quantum reservoirs can be combined with lightweight attention mechanisms, where the reservoir generates nonlinear temporal features and an attention layer performs temporal weighting. This hybrid design may improve performance on complex load patterns without requiring deep reservoirs. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Long-horizon forecasting.**\n",
        "The current study focuses on short-term prediction. Extending to longer horizons may require deeper reservoirs or quantum recurrent structures to improve long-range temporal memory. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Fault-tolerant scaling.**\n",
        "In the longer term, fault-tolerant continuous-variable quantum computing could support larger and more stable reservoirs, enabling scaling beyond NISQ limitations and potentially strengthening theoretical guarantees on expressivity and quantum advantage. \n",
