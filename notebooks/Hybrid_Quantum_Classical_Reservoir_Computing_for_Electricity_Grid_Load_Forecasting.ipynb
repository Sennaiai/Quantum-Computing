    "# Quantum Reservoir Computing for Electricity Grid Load Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Short-term electricity load forecasting is essential for stable and efficient grid operation. While classical machine learning models achieve strong performance, they often require large numbers of trainable parameters to capture nonlinear temporal dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a hybrid quantum–classical forecasting pipeline based on **Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC)**, using half-hourly UK electricity grid data. A continuous-variable quantum reservoir transforms classical time-series inputs into a high-dimensional nonlinear feature space, followed by a lightweight classical readout layer. The model is evaluated against established classical baselines to assess the potential of quantum-enhanced time-series prediction. \n"

    "## 1. Motivation for Quantum-Enhanced Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical machine learning models can achieve high accuracy in electricity load forecasting but often require extensive training and large parameter counts to model nonlinear temporal structure, weather interactions, and seasonal effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum reservoir computing offers an alternative paradigm. Instead of training deep networks, a fixed quantum dynamical system performs nonlinear feature expansion, and only a simple classical readout layer is trained. In principle, quantum dynamics can generate expressive feature maps with fewer trainable parameters, offering a potential path toward more efficient learning as quantum hardware matures. \n"

    "## 2. Choice of Quantum Reservoir Computing Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We adopt **Continuous-Variable Quantum Reservoir Computing (CV-QRC)** as the primary model architecture. CV-QRC is well suited for real-valued time-series data and can encode continuous classical inputs directly into quantum states without requiring large qubit registers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike qubit-based QRC, which relies on discrete two-level systems, CV-QRC uses bosonic modes and naturally models continuous quantities such as amplitudes and phases. This makes it a practical candidate for near-term quantum devices and particularly appropriate for electricity load data, which is inherently continuous. \n"

    "## 4. Quantum Reservoir Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The model employs a fixed continuous-variable quantum circuit as a reservoir. At each time step, classical input features modulate parameters such as displacement or rotation operators. The quantum state evolves under fixed reservoir dynamics, generating a nonlinear transformation of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expectation values of selected observables (e.g., quadrature measurements) are extracted to form the quantum feature vector. A classical linear readout layer is then trained to predict the next-step electricity demand. \n"
