# Quantum Computing  
by **Sennai Kahssai**

Welcome! 
This repository chronicles my journey into **Quantum Computing**, where I explore its intersections with **Machine Learning/AI**, **Cellular & Molecular Biology**, and **Philosophy**.
## About Me
I'm currently pursuing a **Master’s in Quantum Computing** at the **University of Calgary**, with an academic background in **Molecular & Cellular Biology** and **Philosophy**. My focus is on applying quantum technologies to real-world challenges in **molecular biology**, **systems biology**, and **medicine**, guided by philosophical insight.
This repository serves as both a **learning journal** and a **project hub**, where I share concept maps, medium-scale projects, and interdisciplinary reflections as I build my career in the intersecrtion of life scinces and emerging technologies in quantum computing.
