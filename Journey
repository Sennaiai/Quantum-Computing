My learning of quntum biology began in the study of molecular biology and reading books in quantum biology, such as What is Life? by Schrödinger, Life on the
Edge, Physics in Mind, and related works that explore life through quantum principles. These readings, supported by studies in physics, biology, and philosophy,
shaped my curiosity about the quantum nature of living systems. Guided by mentors and philosophical reflection, my interest evolved into a focused pursuit of
quantum computing.

Quantum computing is not a departure from biology but a tool to expand it. I see it as a way to link molecular science with computation and technology. This 
journey continues as I work to bridge biology, computation, and quantum research.

Technical Background

To prepare for quantum computing, I strengthened my foundation in programming and analytics. I had completed two years in Computer Science, then earned a 
graduate certificate in Data Analysis, Big Data, and Predictive Analytics. Through this, I developed skills in Python, SQL, and R.

Introduction to Quantum Computing

I began formal training through a Coursera specialization covering the fundamentals of quantum computing, Python for quantum computing, and Qiskit programming.

Master’s in Quantum Computing

I am pursuing a Master’s in Quantum Computing at the University of Calgary. My courses include Essentials of Quantum Computing, Quantum Software, Applications 
of Quantum Computing, Hardware Quantum Computing, Error Correction and Business Quantum Computing. My projects focus on applying quantum computation to cellular
and molecular biology.

Machine Learning and AI

I am completing an IBM certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I aim to merge ML/AI with quantum computing to develop new methods for 
modeling biological systems and intelligent technologies.

Project Management

Effective project leadership is essential in interdisciplinary work. I am developing project management and communication skills to complement my scientific and 
technical background.
