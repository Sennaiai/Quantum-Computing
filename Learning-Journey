## The Journey's Beginning

My learning journey began with an exploration of quantum biology through foundational texts such as What is Life? by Schr√∂dinger, Life on the Edge: The Coming of Age of Quantum Biology, Physics in Mind and other emerging works on the subject. These readings were complemented by undergraduate coursework in physics, philosophy, and biology. Over time, with the guidance of exceptional mentors and philosophical reflection on biology and emerging technologies, my interest in quantum biology deepened.
In today's increasingly technical and digitized world, the integration of scientific research with computational power has become essential. I chose to pursue quantum computing not as a departure from biology, but as a powerful tool to advance and expand biological research. 
This journey is part of a broader mission to bridge the gap between biology, computation, and emerging quantum technologies. I invite you to follow and join me as we step into the emerging era of applied quantum biology.

## Technical Background

To prepare for my work in quantum computing, I focused on strengthening my foundation in computer science. Though I had completed two years of a Computer Science BSc., I recognized gaps in my technical skills. To address this, I pursued a certificate program in Data Analysis, Big Data, and Predictive Analytics, honing my abilities in Python programming, SQL, and R.

## Introduction to Quantum Computing

I began my formal introduction to quantum computing with a Coursera specialization consisting of three modules: fundamentals of quantum computing, Python for quantum computing, and Qiskit for quantum programming.

## Quantum Computing Master's

Beginning September 2, I will commence my Master‚Äôs in Quantum Computing at the University of Calgary. In the first term the program includes courses such as Essentials of Quantum Computing, Quantum Software I, Applications of Quantum Computing, and Business Quantum Computing I. I will also undertake hands-on projects focused on the application of quantum computing in cellular and molecular biology, supported by expert instructors and peers.

## Machine Learning / AI

I am currently pursuing an IBM certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. The interdisciplinary potential of ML/AI is vast, and its integration with quantum computing holds extraordinary promise. Alongside my Master‚Äôs in Quantum Computing, I am committed to developing expertise in ML/AI to enable powerful synergies between biology and cutting-edge technology.

## Project Management

In addition to technical and scientific competencies, the ability to manage projects effectively is crucial in industry. To navigate interdisciplinary workspaces and lead projects efficiently, I am investing in developing my project management and leadership skills.
